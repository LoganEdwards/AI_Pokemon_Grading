Card grading measurement notes:

For vertical and horizontal borders take measurements of each side and compare with opposite side left/right and top/bottom. These are not exactly followed by the PSA graders, but they play a large part in the overall outcome of the grades. 
PSA Border ratios 
10 = 55/45
9 = 60/40
8 = 65/35
7 = 70/30
6 = 80/20
4 and 5 = 85/15
3 or worse = 90/10

Tools like this can be placed on top of the card and they have a clear interior with lines around the outside with measurements. You can line it up with the center and look at the measurements on the sides. You can compare the measurements with each side and the opposite side to get the ratio. (left - right) and (top - bottom)

Corners:
Look for whitening or dings on the corners. Any sort of damage to the corners or separation from the front and back sides. Typically found by applying filters to it and looking for any differing colors around the borders. Usually looking for white around the sides, also the corners can have different angles which can be taken into account.

Surface:
Look for surface damage like scratches, white marks, folds, or creases. This can be seen by applying computer filter and looking at the gradients. Typically looking for severe changes in color like a crease or crack etc.
